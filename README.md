# Taxi Driver

## What is the Game
You are a taxi driver in this city. Your objective is to take passengers to the destinations that they ask you to. The city is made up of 4 different areas, the city, the housing area, the beach and the airport. As you give rides to passengers you will earn money. Give as many rides as you can to maximise your fare money.

## How to Play

### Basics
In this game you need to collect passengers from the pavement and drop them off at the location they desire. You can interact with passengers by driving up next to them and interacting (Pressing E), this will get them in your taxi. A Large green indicator (Don't mix this up with other passengers) will spawn somewhere along the map. You can turn your head in the taxi to look around for this. The indicator represents the destination of the passenger. Make your way to this indicator, when you have driven close enough to the indicator you will automatically drop off the passenger and give you fare money. You can now pick up another passenger and repeat the process. You will have 180 seconds which is displayed at the top to give as many rides as possible.

### Taxi Interior
You play as a person inside of the taxi. You can move your head using the mouse to look around the taxi and out of the windows. To the left you will see a computer that says "Fares", this is the money you have earn't in this game.

### How are points counted
You earn Â£20 for the drop off. You will also earn a time bonus which is decided by how fast you drop off the passenger. It is calculated by 1000 / Time Taken in seconds.
